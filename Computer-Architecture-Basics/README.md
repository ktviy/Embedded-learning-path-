## Computer Architecture Basics: Building a computer from first principles

## Introduction
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the fundamental knowledge required to design a 16-bit computer architecture from first principles. It will cover core concepts ranging from basic logic gates to a central processing unit (CPU) capable of executing an instruction set architecture (ISA).

## Technical Value
### 1. Boolean Logic & Combinational Circuits
- Design basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, MUX,...) using **NAND** gates
- Build complex circuits for channel selection and data routing (Multi-way MUX/DMUX)

### 2. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Implements binary addition system (Half/Full Adders)
- ALU Core

### 3. Sequential Logic & Memory 
- Building data Bit, registers, and some version of RAM
- Build the program counter (PC) to manage the instruction execution flow

### 4. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Key point of Machine Language
- Low-level programs in **Assembly** to test the correctness of the hardware.

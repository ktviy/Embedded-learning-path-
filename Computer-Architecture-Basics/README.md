## Computer Architecture Basics: Building a computer from first principles

## Introduction
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the fundamental knowledge required to design a 16-bit computer architecture from first principles. It will cover core concepts ranging from basic logic gates to a central processing unit (CPU) capable of executing an instruction set architecture (ISA).

## Computer Architecture Basics: Building a computer from first principles

## Introduction
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the fundamental knowledge required to design a 16-bit computer architecture from first principles. It will cover core concepts ranging from basic logic gates to a central processing unit (CPU) capable of executing an instruction set architecture (ISA).

## Technical Value
* **Boolean Logic Design:** Implementing elementary gates (And, Or, Not, Xor, Mux,...) using only NAND gates as the foundational building block
* **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Designing a functional ALU 
* **Sequential Logic & State:** Implementing Bit, Register, and some version of RAM and the Program Counter (PC) for instruction flow control
* **ISA & Low-level Programming**

I. Architecture overview
  The Hack architecture is a 16-bit Von Neumann system, consisting of a CPU, two separate memory entities (Instruction Memory and Data Memory), and two main registers.

II. Registers
*  A-register: stores both data and memory addresses
*  D-register: stores the data
* M (Memory): represents the memory location in RAM whose address is currently stored in register A (RAM[A])

III. Instructions
1. A-instruction - Address assignment command

@value -> A = value
@sum -> A = address of variable sum

2. C-instruction (16 bits) - Control command
Used for performing ALU calculations and branching

+ a & cccccc: Bits control ALU (determine the operations)
+ ddd (Destination): Stores the result
+ jjj (Jump): Controls jump (JGT, JEQ, JGE, JLT, JNE, JLE, JMP)


** Operations
a/ D=M -> read only

b/ M=D -> write the value from D to RAM
   eg: @10 // A = 10
       M=A // RAM[10] = 10

c/ M=A -> Assign the number directly, write value A in the address A points to
   eg: @21 // A = 21
       D=A // D = 21

d/ D=A -> Copy value in A to D

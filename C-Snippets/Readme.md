# C-Snippets: Fundamental C Programming for Low-Level Systems

## Introduction
The repository contains C code snippets that focus on foundational concepts, especially **Pointers** and **Dynamic Memory Allocation**. Each file focuses on simulating each phase of embedded software development. Each file is a gradually upgraded version that reflects the knowledge system of the same program. The idea of ​​the original code is to receive sensor data and print it to the screen.

## Technical value
1. **Manual Memory Management:** `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, và `free()` - allocate and free memory on the Heap.
2. **Low-level Programming:** how variables are stored in memory and how **Pointers** are used to directly manipulate addresses. 
3. **Systems Programming thinking:** avoid memory leaks and out-of-bounds access errors.

# CPP-OOP-Embedded: C++ OOP and Bitwise Operations for Embedded Systems

## Introduction
This repository shows the switch between high-level programming (C++ OOP) and low-level programming (Bitwise C), which is fundamental to hardware/software co-design 

## Core skills
1. **C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** use 'Classes', 'Constructors/Destructors', and 'Encapsulation', to build complex models
2. **Bitwise Operations:** Directly manipulating individual bits
